     * and no capitals for an entire episode. That is not cosmetic: it segments
     * on sentence structure, so with no full stops the cue boundaries stop
     * tracking speech and every timestamp derived from them is unreliable. It
     * hit 654 episodes, and 13 survived every attempt to re-decode them.
     *
     * An initial prompt fixed **all 13**. Measured on the same set:
     *
     *   initial_prompt      13/13
     *   whisper large-v3    10/13
     *   best VAD parameter   9/13
     *   Silero VAD v6.2.0    6/13
     *   another threshold    0/13
     *
     * It works because this is a DECODER mode, not a segmentation problem --
     * every VAD setting only changes what audio reaches the decoder, while a
     * prompt conditions the decoder itself, and punctuation is a style.
     *
     * Deliberately generic prose. An initial prompt biases VOCABULARY as well
     * as style, so anything domain-specific would contaminate transcripts.
     * Verified on a repaired episode: zero occurrences of any prompt fragment,
     * word count within 5% of the original.

     * server silently put this pipeline on greedy decoding.
     *
     * Greedy's characteristic failure here is repetition: it locks onto a
     * phrase and emits it for minutes. Measured across the first eleven
     * regenerated shows it hits 0.7%-5.0% of episodes per show, and the repair
     * pass that cleans them up runs beam. That pass has now fixed **57 of 57**
     * such episodes, most on its first attempt.
     *
     * A paired trial on one show -- same audio, same model, same fields, only
     * this value moved -- found beam equal or better on healthy material:

     *   clamped / unpunctuated    0 either way
     *
     * The costs are real but small: roughly 30% more decode time, and about
     * 12% fewer cues. Coarser cues used to matter because the cue was the
     * floor on how precisely a span boundary could be placed; with per-word
     * times in `words.jsonl.gz` it no longer is.
