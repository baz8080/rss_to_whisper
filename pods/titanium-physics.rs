<p class="p1">"First of all I really enjoy the podcast!  And for a while I’ve been wanting to send in this question and think it would be perfect for the new segment.  My question is:  What direction would one look to see the big bang? Now, I understand that we are in an ever expanding universe and technically the big bang is in all directions but I guess I’m having a hard time mentally grasping the concept. I’ve heard the balloon analogy but I just can’t understand that if I was expanding on an inflating balloon I would still be able to look to the center of said balloon, right?!. Conversely, would it be possible to look away from the big bang and into the space our universe is expanding into?</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">I hope this hasn’t already been covered but if it has would it be possible to go more in depth with an explanation of the expansion itself. Thanks for such an awesome podcast! </p>

<p> </p>
<p>the question is from bob:</p>
<p>"Hello again Ben. I've found and listened to the QB episodes. Thanks for the help with locating them.</p>
<p class="p1">Since you seem to have ready access to a cosmologist, I'd like to offer for QB a trio of related cosmological questions that have bugged me for some time.</p>
<p class="p1">1. How do we know that all the matter in the universe came from the big bang?</p>
<p class="p1">2. How do we know that the big bang did not expand into an existing precursor universe? (It seems plausible to me that this may be the case but we have no way to know because the hyperinflation immediately after the big bang and accelerating expansion due to dark energy will permanently keep us outside of the light cone of any event in this hypothetical precursor universe. I'm not fond of unfalsifiable theories...)"</p>]]></description>

<p class="p1">Since you seem to have ready access to a cosmologist, I'd like to offer for QB a trio of related cosmological questions that have bugged me for some time.</p>
<p class="p1">1. How do we know that all the matter in the universe came from the big bang?</p>
<p class="p1">2. How do we know that the big bang did not expand into an existing precursor universe? (It seems plausible to me that this may be the case but we have no way to know because the hyperinflation immediately after the big bang and accelerating expansion due to dark energy will permanently keep us outside of the light cone of any event in this hypothetical precursor universe. I'm not fond of unfalsifiable theories...)"</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our guests today are Matt Sheehy from the band '<a href="http://lost-lander.com/">Lost Lander</a>' and Brent Knopf from the band '<a href="http://ramonafalls.com/">Ramona Falls</a>'. </p>
<p>the show is super extra long and we talk about everythinggg! from how magnetic fields are generated, to how magnets work, to how to levitate a frog, to how the sun and earth's magnetic fields work, to how guitar pickups work. it's a good episode.</p>
<p>you should note that a lot of the topics we mention (solar flares, superconductors) have their OWN EPSIODES all about them. </p>]]></description>

<p>So back when i started the show I sent Catherine an email. She's always been one of my most gifted astronomy friends. I said "hey, give me a topic for the show."

<p>she persisted. </p>
<p>i gave in.</p>
<p>and we put together a show about SWIRLS ON THE MOON. </p>

<p>our guest is Kai Nagata, and the physicists are Laura Hainline and Mike Zemcov.</p>

<p>three things to note:</p>
<p>1) listen past the end credits to hear a long-ass conversation about whether having free energy is a good thing. </p>
<p>2) Kai's internet connection was lousy and kept dropping out. so today's episode is less conversational than we are used to. we had to fix it in editing.</p>

<p>So when I started the show, everyone was like "HEY BEN! DO A SHOW ON THE HIGGS"</p>
<p>and i was like "No, it's boring and hard to explain and they aren't even going to find it anyway."</p>
<p>then they found it and everyone was like "Hey Ben! Do a show on the higgs!"</p>
<p>and i was like "ugh, I need to do at least four episodes. One on particle decay, one on particel detectors, one on the higgs field, and then maybe a detailed on on how they found it. but that's hard..."</p>
<p>anyway. So. here's a show on the Higgs field. It's how everything gets mass. kind of. we're in tip of the iceberg territory here.</p>
<p>OKAY! SO!</p>
<p>Today's physicists are Tia Miceli, and Matt Buckley.</p>
<p>and our guest today is Greg Proops,<a href="http://www.gregproops.com/blog/smartest-man-in-the-world-podcast/"> The smartest man in the world</a>. </p>

<p>if you answer it, send me an email and i'll send you a prize.</p>
<p>lets talk shop.</p>
<p>1) todays show is about quantum tunneling. it features henry Reich blowing us all out of the water with his high caliber explanations. It also features Justin Pierce of Wonderella fame. you should watch one minute physics videos and read wonderella. skip work today.</p>
<p>2.0) sorry about the sound quality, i'm still fighting a new internet connection. I'm doing my best, and i have honestly spent about 12 hours edting this. </p>
<p>2.1) at the end of the show is a lot of content that I threw into the appendices. enjoy. </p>
<p>2) Apple has a new podcast app. go see if you can find us on it? if you can't write us a review or something. I'm still trying to wrangle it currently. I hate it when things change.</p>
<p>3) maybe nominations for this year's podcasting awards are going to open up? maybe we should be nominated for the science category? maybe we don't stand a chance against those skeptics podcasts. maybe lots of things happen. getting on that list sure would make a lot of people notice the show though.</p>
<p>4) KEEP SCIENCE IN YOUR HEARTS!</p>
<p>5) If we get nominated for a podcasting award, i'll try to find a better (cheaper) place that sells t-shirts. then, tshirts for everyone!</p>]]></description>

<p>and we're doing it with <a href="http://wondermark.com/">David Malki!</a>  </p>
<p>this episode is pretty rad.</p>
<p>listen past the end music to hear a lot of silly conversations. there are a lot of them. :( why does my show have to be half an hour of ramming physics down your gullet? why cant i leave the funny and distracting stuff in context? If you know the answer to these questions, email me, and I'll give you a prize. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone! </p>
<p>I decided to do a show on Quasars. because I didn't know what they were. So then I looked It up. Turns out, they're black holes! My Favourite.</p>
<p>I also looked up two of my other favourites, Laura Hainline and Sean Moran. Turns out, they know Everything about Quasars. </p>
<p>So then I looked up the author of one of my<a href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/"> favourite webcomic</a>s,  Howard Tayler.</p>
<p>This show is fantastic. Too bad we had to record the show using two tin cans and a piece of string, and an old wax cylinder sound recorder. Oh well. It's not like I have any money to spend on sound quality (I spend it all on quality of character).</p>
<p></p>
<p>by the way, if anyone can spot the magical SUPERFLUOUS word I've worked into the usual script, send me an email with it as the subject line, and I'll write you back a prize. </p>
<p>the prize is a haiku about whatever's on my mind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also note that there are a couple extra bits after the bunny song. not much. I left a couple extra (edited) minutes in the regular part of the show, so we ran a couple min overtime. </p>
