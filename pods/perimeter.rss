She is also the founder and director of Laurier’s Centre for Women in Science (WinS) and an NSERC Chair for Women in Science and Engineering. In this episode, she takes Lauren and Colin on a journey into the subatomic realm to explore concepts like entanglement, superposition, and her personal favourite quantum quandary: uncertainty. She explains how ideas in quantum science can translate to questions of identity, and how that drives her efforts to improve equity and diversity in science. She also thoughtfully answers questions submitted by elementary school students, and provides a sneak peek into the topics of her upcoming book.

She is also the founder and director of Laurier’s Centre for Women in Science (WinS) and an NSERC Chair for Women in Science and Engineering. In this episode, she takes Lauren and Colin on a journey into the subatomic realm to explore concepts like entanglement, superposition, and her personal favourite quantum quandary: uncertainty. She explains how ideas in quantum science can translate to questions of identity, and how that drives her efforts to improve equity and diversity in science. She also thoughtfully answers questions submitted by elementary school students, and provides a sneak peek into the topics of her upcoming book.

In this episode, he tells Lauren and Colin about his work on a kind of uber-theory that encompasses all quantum field theories, as well as what separates the easy and hard problems in this field. It’s a complicated topic to be sure, but Vieira is a master of explaining complex topics with relatable examples and anecdotes – something Lauren discovered as a student when she took a course he taught. “Pedro takes some of those same concepts from graduate courses, but he paints some amazing non-technical pictures for us,” says Lauren. “No mathematical background required!” He explains why the universe might be a hologram and why, from a theoretical physics perspective, a messy bedroom can be a good thing.

<p>Baskaran expresses deep gratitude for the people who helped him on his journey, like his high school math teacher, Mr. S.V. Savarimuthu, and his English teacher, Rev. Fr. K.S. Arulanandam, S.J. Baskaran also reached out after our recorded conversation to extend his thanks to others who have impacted his career, including Dr. Rajaram Nityananda, a contemporary graduate student (from National Aeronautical Laboratory, Bangalore) during his PhD days in Bangalore. “Rajaram is one of the most selfless persons I have ever met,” says Baskaran. It was Rajaram who introduced Baskaran to seminal work by P.W. Anderson, a later collaborator of Baskaran’s. </p>
<p>“In 1977, H.R. Krishnamurthy arrived from Cornell and explained to us the intricacies of the Kondo phenomenon, valence fluctuation, and how to understand them using the quantum RG approach (built on Anderson’s poor man’s scaling theory) that Krishnamurthy, Wilkinson, and Wilson had just developed. Anderson’s masterly role in modern condensed matter physics was manifest. Strong correlation physics, including Mott insulators, was in the air,” Baskaran says. </p>
<p>Later in his career, Baskaran worked with professors who played a “lifting role” in his life, including R. Rajaraman, G. Rajasekaran, and Erio Tosatti.</p>
<p>“I am thankful to my school, college, teachers, friends, my family, my mom Leelavathy, my dad Ganapathy, siblings, uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews, my wife Whiterose, my children, their spouses, and my grandchildren.”</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>On May 12, 2022, the global Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration unveiled the landmark first image of the black hole at the heart of our own Milky Way galaxy, called Sagittarius A* (or Sgr A*). On this special episode of Conversations at the Perimeter, Lauren and Colin talk with astrophysicist Avery Broderick about the significance of this discovery. He explains how the EHT collaboration created an “Earth-sized telescope” – a network of eight radio telescopes on five continents, all focussed on a single spot on the night sky: the heart of the Milky Way, 27,000 light-years from Earth. Broderick holds the Delaney Family John Archibald Wheeler Chair at Perimeter, and is an associate faculty member jointly appointed to Perimeter and the University of Waterloo. He also leads the EHT Initiative at Perimeter Institute, which is one of the 13 partner organizations in the EHT. Although his childhood dream of voyaging through the universe on the Starship Enterprise remains out of reach, Broderick says hunting black holes (or "fire donuts," as he playfully calls them) is the next-best thing.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>They often debate the workings of black holes and the big bang at Perimeter Institute’s blackboards -- and sometimes at the breakfast table too. Ghazal Geshnizjani and Niayesh Afshordi split their time between investigating the mysteries of the cosmos and raising their young family. Both are researchers at Perimeter Institute and the University of Waterloo, exploring concepts like the beginning of the universe, the extreme gravity of black hole singularities, the mysteries of dark energy, and other big open questions in astrophysics. Both are also passionate about sparking a love of science in others (including their kids), which led Ghazal to write the illustrated children’s book <a href='https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09VWP33CN'>Bella the Black Hole</a>. In this conversation with Lauren and Colin, they explain the big challenges that drive them, and how their differing individual approaches to research complement one another.
