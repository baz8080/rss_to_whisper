They find out exactly how spiders copulate - a process full of surprises - from males having two penises to females cannibalizing the males once the deed is done.

With these new advances comes the exciting prospect of not only living longer, but more importantly living healthier and happier and free of disease well into our hundreds.  </p><p>Executive Producer: Alexandra Feachem</p>]]></itunes:summary><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><itunes:duration>2539</itunes:duration><enclosure url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p0dd47sw.mp3" length="40624000" type="audio/mpeg"/><ppg:enclosureLegacy url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p0dd47sw.mp3" length="40624000" type="audio/mpeg"/><ppg:enclosureSecure url="https://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/https/vpid/p0dd47sw.mp3" length="40624000" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:bbc:podcast:p0dcn524</guid><link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0dcn524</link><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><media:content url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p0dd47sw.mp3" fileSize="40624000" type="audio/mpeg" medium="audio" expression="full" duration="2539"/><itunes:author>BBC Radio 4</itunes:author><ppg:canonical>/programmes/p0dcn524</ppg:canonical></item><item><title>Hunting for Exoplanets</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Brian Cox and Robin Ince continue their LA science adventure as they visit  Caltech in Pasadena to meet the scientists hunting for planets orbiting distant stars in solar systems far far from our own.

From extraordinary life forms with incredible survival strategies, to the gruesome sex life of the angler fish, the panel discuss some of the greatest discoveries of the last few years, and what questions they still hope to answer.</p><p>Executive Producer: Alexandra Feachem</p>]]></itunes:summary><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 18:15:00 +0000</pubDate><itunes:duration>2569</itunes:duration><enclosure url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p0cj5rxt.mp3" length="41104000" type="audio/mpeg"/><ppg:enclosureLegacy url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p0cj5rxt.mp3" length="41104000" type="audio/mpeg"/><ppg:enclosureSecure url="https://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/https/vpid/p0cj5rxt.mp3" length="41104000" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:bbc:podcast:m0018wsw</guid><link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0018wsw</link><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><media:content url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p0cj5rxt.mp3" fileSize="41104000" type="audio/mpeg" medium="audio" expression="full" duration="2569"/><itunes:author>BBC Radio 4</itunes:author><ppg:canonical>/programmes/m0018wsw</ppg:canonical></item><item><title>Bats v Flies</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Brian Cox and Robin Ince kick off the new series by tackling one of the greatest questions ever posed by science: which are better, bats or flies?</p><p>Joining them for this unusual version of animal Top Trumps are a bat expert (Prof Kate Jones), a fly expert (Dr Erica McAlister) and Dave Gorman.

And Claude Nicollier describes his epic spacewalk to repair the Hubble Telescope. </p><p>Producer: Alexandra Feachem.</p>]]></itunes:summary><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><itunes:duration>2658</itunes:duration><enclosure url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p057wwvl.mp3" length="42528000" type="audio/mpeg"/><ppg:enclosureLegacy url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p057wwvl.mp3" length="42528000" type="audio/mpeg"/><ppg:enclosureSecure url="https://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/https/vpid/p057wwvl.mp3" length="42528000" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:bbc:podcast:b08x8y1g</guid><link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08x8y1g</link><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><media:content url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p057wwvl.mp3" fileSize="42528000" type="audio/mpeg" medium="audio" expression="full" duration="2658"/><itunes:author>BBC Radio 4</itunes:author><ppg:canonical>/programmes/b08x8y1g</ppg:canonical></item><item><title>What Particles Remain to be Discovered?</title><description><![CDATA[<p>"What Particles Remain to be Discovered?"</p><p>Brian Cox and Robin Ince return for a new series of the hugely popular, multi-award winning science/comedy show.

Brian Cox and Robin Ince are joined by comedian Katy Brand, Cosmologist Prof Carlos Frenk, and biologist Prof Matthew Cobb to discover how to make the seemingly invisible, visible. They look at how the history and development of the telescope and the microscope have allowed us to look at the impossibly big to the seemingly impossibly small, to gain insight into the history of our universe and the inner workings of the human body. They look at how radio and space telescopes have allowed us to look back in time and "see" the big bang, and understand the age and content of the early universe, and how space telescopes have thrown light on the mysterious substance known as dark matter. They also look at the way microscopes and new biological techniques have allowed us to understand the seemingly invisible processes going on inside our cells. They also ask what, if anything, will always remain invisible to us - are there some processes or concepts that are impossible for us to "see". </p><p>Producer: Alexandra Feachem.</p>]]></description><itunes:subtitle>Brian Cox and Robin Ince discover how science can make the invisible visible.</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Making the Invisible, Visible

Penned by listeners as young as 10 and as old as 77, subjects include the nature of black holes, the mathematical abilities of chimpanzees, the suicidal tendencies of robots and complaints about infinity that will run and run. 
 
But will they be able to answer perhaps the greatest question of all - is a strawberry dead?
